##  OOD Hw Task 1 
A Java application for a template to predict hurricanes
##
Task 1 Uses both Command and a template pattern, 
Template is used for The Predicition model, the concrete implementations, statisical & Machine Learning
Command is used for the encapsulation of Fetchdata, and other methods within The the prediction model
The Main creates all the objects and calls the invoker to generate the Whole Predictions, statisical is used in main however 
Machine Learning could do the same thing. 
##
Design Patterns Implemented
## 1. Command
Commands for Fetch Data, Save Results, and Prediction Model , used with the Command Invoker
## 2. Template
A template for HUrrican prediction Models, implemented in concrete classe Statistical and Machine Learning as examples
##
Features
